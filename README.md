# Hi there 👋 How are you doing

### Did you know? the average human life spans 4,000 weeks.
❓ **Do you have statistics about how you use?**

So far, I do. For me, it was approximately NaN% of my life; It was the beginning of the career period. And I've decided to use it as *Software developer*. 

📊 So, this graph represents my remaining life time spent attempting to improve and learn new things every day.
